                      The Beehive Automation Project is among the creations that aim to bring new approaches to the process of managing beehives in order to maximize honey yields. This end-of-campus project demonstrate the hardware software and IoT technology that are useful in apprehending and regulating the conditions within the beehive systematically. 
                      
                      Key Features: 
                      
                      Real-time Monitoring: In this regard, the project incorporates a DHT temperature and humidity sensor to keep checking the status of the within-beneath beehive circumstances without pause. This information is sent through a NodeMCU WiFi development board to a chosen application or website by the user which gives beekeepers a good analytical view of the hives. 
                      Bee Venom Extraction Automation: An equipment used to recover bee venom is provided and designed as a bee venom extraction machine which is set to work at mid-night per day. It is equally important to note that this method of venom collection is less complicated, not to mention efficient, by virtue of being fully automated. 
                      Temperature Regulation: Use of a fan is provided in the system to control the temperatures inside the hive. From the sensor, the fan is controlled to operate in order to maintain conducive conditions for the bees and or the production of honey. 
                      Prototype Demonstration: Due to time constraint and limitations in the availability of a real ultraviolet lamp, LED bulbs were used in simulating the movements of the fan and the vibration of the bee venom extractor. Actually, this functional strategy provided several benefits and successfully demonstrated the effectiveness of the intended system. 
                      Benefits: 
                      
                      Improved Bee Health: Sustaining appropriate temperature and humidity levels in the project assists in warding off diseases and stress making bee’s healthy and productive thus enhancing honey production. 
                      Efficient Beekeeping: Process like venom extraction and regulation of the temperature can be automated and therefore reduce the efforts of the beekeepers. 
                      Data-Driven Decisions: The information accumulated real-time allows beekeepers making proper decisions about the hives, including such aspects as potential problems identifying at the early stage. 
                      Enhanced Honey Quality: Some of the factors that affect honey quality includes; Prolonged environmental factors enhance the quality of honey. 
                      All in all, the Beehive Automation Project will be one of the most effective solutions in an ever-evolving industry such as beekeeping. For this reason, the project that has incorporated technology and beekeeping expertise has come up with a system that can be of great advantage both to beekeepers and honey production.
